Please generate a fine-tuning training dataset for a supportive chatbot model that provides emotional support tailored to adults. The chatbot will offer empathetic, supportive, and practical guidance on various emotional well-being issues, such as stress management, work-life balance, relationship struggles, financial concerns, and personal growth.

Instructions
Response Control:
Wait for my command to begin:
When I say start, begin generating the dataset according to the guidelines below.
When I say continue, generate the next set of entries.
Only proceed after I give the command.
Output Format:
Each dataset item should be in plain text, formatted as a single JSON object.

All dataset items must be contained inside an array and separated by commas.

Ensure the array opens with a square bracket [ and closes with a square bracket ].

Example of the output: [ {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "[Detailed system description here]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "[User input here]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[Assistant response here]"}]}, {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "[Detailed system description here]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "[Another user input here]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[Another assistant response here]"}]}, {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "[Detailed system description here]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "[Yet another user input here]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[Yet another assistant response here]"}]} ]

Include a comma between each JSON object, but do not include a trailing comma after the last object.

System Description:
Provide a detailed description of the chatbot’s purpose, audience, and tone. For example: "The assistant is a supportive and empathetic chatbot trained to provide guidance to adults dealing with emotional challenges such as workplace stress, personal relationships, and financial anxieties. It tailors its tone to the user’s style and provides practical advice, motivational support, or empathetic listening as needed."

Purpose and Scope
Purpose: Train the chatbot to deliver emotional support for adults on topics such as:

Managing work-related stress
Balancing career and personal life
Navigating relationship challenges
Dealing with financial anxiety
Improving self-esteem
Response Guidelines:

Response Length: Adjust the response length based on the user’s input (short prompts receive short responses, long prompts receive detailed responses).
Tone: Empathetic, supportive, or practical, depending on the context of the user’s input.
Formality: Match the chatbot’s formality level to the user’s tone.
Response Styles: Incorporate empathetic listening, practical advice, and motivational support.
Generation Process
Rounds:
Generate data in rounds of 10 entries until the dataset reaches 1,500 entries.
Ensure that all dataset items are part of a single array, with items delimited by commas.
Progress Notations:
Before starting each round, include a progress update in this format:

🐰🐰🐰 Generated: Y | Remaining: Z | Iteration: A/B | | [YY MM DD HH:mm:ss] 🐰🐰🐰
Where:
Y is the total number of entries generated so far.
Z is the remaining entries to reach 1,500.
A is the current iteration number.
B is the total iterations (150 for 1,500 entries in rounds of 10).

Segment Indicators:
Surround each segment of 10 entries with clear markers:

---------------------start_of_training_data_set_iteration_A_of_B---------------------
[{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "[Detailed system description here]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "[User input here]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[Assistant response here]"}]},
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "[Detailed system description here]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "[Another user input here]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[Another assistant response here]"}]},
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "[Detailed system description here]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "[Yet another user input here]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[Yet another assistant response here]"}]}]
---------------------end_of_training_data_set_iteration_A_of_B---------------------
Completion Indicators:
After completing all 1,500 entries, include this line:

🐻🐻🐻 Training data set generation completed | Iterations completed: A | [YY MM DD HH:mm:ss] 🐻🐻🐻

Once the entire dataset is complete, display:
