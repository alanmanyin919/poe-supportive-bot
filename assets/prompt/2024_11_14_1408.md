Please generate a fine-tuning training dataset for a supportive chatbot model that provides emotional support across various combinations. This chatbot will offer empathetic, supportive, and practical guidance on issues like depression, anxiety, loneliness, stress, and self-esteem.

Instructions:
Response Control:

Wait for my command to begin:
When I say start, begin generating the dataset according to the guidelines below.
When I say continue, generate the next set of entries.
Only proceed after each command.
Output Format:

Structure each entry as a JSON object in the following format, ensuring each entry is on one line:

{ "messages": [ {"role": "System", "content": "[Detailed system description here]"}, {"role": "User", "content": "[User input here]"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "content": "[Chatbot response here]"} ] }

System description: Provide a thorough description of the chatbot’s role, target audience, tone, topics addressed, response style, and expected formality for each combination.

Important: Each 10-entry generation should be contained within the same paragraph, separated by a new line for each entry to enhance readability and ensure easy copying.

Purpose and Scope:
Purpose: Train the chatbot to deliver emotional support across various topics, including depression, anxiety, loneliness, stress, academic and career pressures, and self-esteem.

Response Guidelines:

Response Length: Match the response length to the user prompt length (short prompts receive short responses; long prompts receive detailed responses).
Formality Level: Align the chatbot’s formality level to match the user’s formality.
Response Styles: Include empathy, problem-solving, motivational support, and practical advice.
Generation Process:
Combination Progression: Fully complete each combination set of 1,500 entries before moving to the next combination.

Rounds: Generate data in rounds of 10 entries until each combination’s 1,500 entries are complete.

Progress Notations:

Before starting each round, include a progress update with the following format:

🐰🐰🐰 Dataset for Combination Set X: Generated: Y, Remaining: Z | Iteration: A/B 🐰🐰🐰

Where:
X is the combination number.
Y is the total number of entries generated so far for this combination.
Z is the remaining number of entries to reach 1,500 for this combination.
A is the current iteration number.
B is the total number of iterations (should be 150 for 1,500 entries in rounds of 10).
Segment Indicators: Surround each segment of 10 entries with clear markers, as follows:

---------------------start_of_training_data_set_combination_X_iteration_A_of_B---------------------

(10 entries here in JSON format, separated by a new line between each entry for clarity)

---------------------end_of_training_data_set_combination_X_iteration_A_of_B---------------------

After fully generating a combination, add this line:

🐻🐻🐻 Training data set generation for Combination X completed | Iterations completed: A | Total time spent: [Include if possible] 🐻🐻🐻

Upon generating all combinations, display:

🦊🦊🦊 ALL COMBINATION GENERATION COMPLETED 🦊🦊🦊

Combination Sets:
Generate 500 distinct combinations, each containing 1,500 entries. Use the examples below to structure each combination.

Example Combinations:
Combination 1:

Target Users: Teenagers facing academic and social pressures
