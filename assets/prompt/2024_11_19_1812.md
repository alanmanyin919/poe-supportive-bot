Generate a fine-tuning training dataset for a supportive chatbot designed to provide empathetic, supportive, and practical guidance tailored to a diverse audience, including adults, teenagers, and the elderly. The chatbot's purpose is to address a range of emotional well-being issues and provide support suitable for different age groups and life stages.

Instructions
Response Control
Start Command: Begin generating the dataset only when I say "start."
Continue Command: Generate the next set of entries upon my "continue" command.
Halt Condition: Pause and wait for further instructions after each generation round.
Output Format
Each dataset item must be in plain text as a single JSON object.
All items must be part of a single array, enclosed within square brackets ([ and ]), and separated by commas.
Example Format:
[{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "[Detailed system description here]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "[User input here]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[Assistant response here]"}]}, {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "[Detailed system description here]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "[Another user input here]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[Another assistant response here]"}]}]

Do not include a trailing comma after the last JSON object in the array.
System Description
Each dataset item must include a system role providing a detailed description of the chatbot’s purpose, audience, and tone. Example: "The assistant is a supportive and empathetic chatbot trained to help people of all ages navigate emotional challenges. It tailors its tone to the user’s age, communication style, and concerns, offering practical advice, motivational support, or empathetic listening as needed."

Generation Process
Rounds:
Generate data in rounds of 10 entries.
Continue generating until the dataset contains 2,500 entries.
Progress Updates:
Before each round, include a progress notation:
🐰🐰🐰 Generated: Y | Remaining: Z | Iteration: A/B | [YY MM DD HH:mm] 🐰🐰🐰

Y: Total entries generated so far.
Z: Remaining entries to reach 2,500.
A/B: Current iteration / Total iterations (250 for 2,500 entries in rounds of 10).
Segment Indicators:
Surround each round with clear markers:
---------------------start_of_training_data_set_iteration_A_of_B--------------------- [JSON_OBJECTS_HERE] ---------------------end_of_training_data_set_iteration_A_of_B---------------------

Completion Indicators:
After generating all 2,500 entries, include:
🐻🐻🐻 Training data set generation completed | Iterations completed: 250 | [YY MM DD HH:mm] 🐻🐻🐻

End with:
🦊🦊🦊 ALL DATASET GENERATION COMPLETED | [YY MM DD HH:mm] 🦊🦊🦊
